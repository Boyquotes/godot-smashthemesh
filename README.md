## Introduction

**Smash The Mesh (STM)** is a Godot add-on that allows you to **break a 3D mesh** into **multiple pieces** and then **apply physics** to each fragment. It also offers the ability to **save the results to disk (cache)** and load them quickly, thereby avoiding the need for repetitive, often time-consuming computations.

#### *Note*: This is a *BETA* version and is still under development. It should be tested thoroughly to assess its suitability for your needs.

### Under the Hood

STM uses Godot's **Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)** system to create fragments from a mesh.

## STM Nodes

- <h3> <img src="addons/smash_the_mesh/stm_icon.svg" width="20"/> STMInstance3D</h3>

  This class is ideal for handling lightweight geometry (with few chunks) that doesn't require intensive computation. It can automatically break a mesh and apply physics to the resulting chunks. This can be done either at loading time (with `preloading = true`) or when the `smash_the_mesh()` method is called. For performance-critical scenarios, it is highly recommended to use `STMCachedInstance3D`.

- <h3> <img src="addons/smash_the_mesh/stm_cached_icon.svg" width="20"/> STMCachedInstance3D</h3>

  This class extends `STMInstance3D` by adding a caching system that only recomputes data when it becomes invalid (for example, if you change the generation parameters). The cache is stored as a compressed scene on the disk, with the default path set to `res://stm_cache/`. This cache can be reused across multiple instances with the same geometry. However, be cautious when dealing with a lot of geometry and many fragments, as the size of the cache file will increase. Itâ€™s a good idea to periodically check the folder.

  To open a cache file, simply double-click on it. You can inspect the result and even make edits as needed, but it's important to maintain the tree structure. Note that manually modifying a cache file will invalidate it, so be sure to set `can_write = false` to ensure your changes are not overwritten the next time the program runs.

## API Documentation

### `is_smashed() -> bool`
**Description:**  
Returns `true` if the current instance has been smashed, otherwise returns `false`.

### `smash_the_mesh()`
**Description:**  
Hides the mesh of the current instance and spawns the physical chunks in its place.  
Note: The chunks will not appear until this method is called.

### `add_physics_to_self()`
**Description:**  
Automatically adds a `RigidBody3D` and a `CollisionShape3D` to the current instance, using the same physics settings as the chunks.

### `chunks_iterate(callback: Callable)`
**Description:**  
Iterates over all the chunks' `RigidBody3D` instances, allowing you to perform operations on the chunks of this instance.  
**Example usage:**

```gdscript
# Apply a force to all chunks
callback := func(rb: RigidBody3D, from: DestructableMesh):
    var collision_shape = rb.get_child(0) as CollisionShape3D
    var mesh_instance = collision_shape.get_child(0) as MeshInstance3D
```

### `chunks_get_elapsed_time() -> float`
**Description:**  
Returns the time elapsed (in seconds) since `smash_the_mesh()` was called.  
Returns `0` if `smash_the_mesh()` has not been called.

### `chunks_restart_elapsed_time()`
**Description:**  
Updates the elapsed time as if `smash_the_mesh()` was just called.  
This is useful for restarting time-based animations without restoring the chunks to their original state.

### `chunks_kill()`
**Description:**  
Removes all the chunks of this mesh instance.

### `chunks_reset()`
**Description:**  
Resets this instance to its state before `smash_the_mesh()` was called.

### `chunks_freeze(enable: bool)`
**Description:**  
Freezes or unfreezes the physics simulation of the chunks.  
- `enable`: Pass `true` to freeze the simulation, or `false` to unfreeze it.

### `chunks_repair(weight: float)`
**Description:**  
Reverts the chunks to their starting position.  
- `weight`: The amount of repair, from `0` (no repair) to `1` (fully repaired).  
This method can be called each frame with a low value of `weight` to create a backward animation to the original position.  
**Tip:** Ensure that `chunks_freeze()` is called before using this method to avoid disrupting the physics simulation.

## Cache System Documentation

<p align="center"> 
  <img src="media/stm_cache_system.jpg"/>   
</p>

### `@export var cache_write: bool = true`
**Description:**  
When enabled, the cache will be overwritten when the cached data becomes invalid.  
If multiple instances use the same cache file, it is advisable to have only one instance with `cache_write = true`. This allows you to modify the cache data for all instances from a single point (the instance with `cache_write = true`).

### `@export var cache_read: bool = true`
**Description:**  
When enabled, the object will attempt to load data from the cache file instead of computing it.  
- If the cache isn't found, the data will be computed (either at loading time or when needed).
- If `cache_write = true`, the computed data will be saved to disk, preventing future computations.
- If `cache_read = false`, the data will always be computed at run-time.

### `@export var cache_is_saved: bool = false`
**Description:**  
An informational property (not meant to be modified) that indicates whether this instance can read the cache from disk without the need to recompute the data.

### `@export_file("*.scn") var cache_name: String = str(get_instance_id())`
**Description:**  
Specifies the name of the cache file on disk.  
- To have multiple instances of the same object read from the same cache, set the same `cache_name` for all instances.
- In this case, it is advisable to disable `cache_write` for all instances except one, which can be used to modify the cache.
- To ensure that the cache data is never overwritten, set `cache_write = false` for all objects.

### `@export var cache_baked_shape: bool = true`
**Description:**  
When enabled, the collision shape of the chunks will be read directly from the cache without being recomputed.  
- If you want to keep the chunk data from the cache but use a different collision shape, set `cache_baked_shape = false`.

### `@export var cache_baked_physics: bool = false`
**Description:**  
When enabled, all physics data of the chunks will be read directly from the cache without being recomputed.  
- If you want to keep the chunk data from the cache but use different physics settings, set `cache_baked_physics = false`.

## Chunks Generation Documentation

<p align="center"> 
  <img src="media/stm_chunks_generation.jpg"/>   
</p>

### `@export var original_mesh: Mesh`
**Description:**  
Specifies the original (source) mesh that you want to break into chunks.

### `@export var chunk_brush: Mesh = StandardBrush`
**Description:**  
Defines the mesh used as an intersection volume for each voxel to create the chunks.  
- The shape of the brush can significantly influence the result and may cause unwanted artifacts if not chosen carefully.
- If you create custom brush meshes, keep them centered on the origin of the system with a size close to `1x1x1` to avoid unpredictable results.
- A set of experimental brush meshes is available in the "brushes" sub-folder. For example, the "wood" brush has been used for simulating the breaking of wood material.

### `@export var chunk_inner_material: StandardMaterial3D`
**Description:**  
Specifies the material to be used for the inner parts of the chunks.

### `@export var chunk_count: Vector3i = Vector3i(2, 2, 2)`
**Description:**  
Represents the 3D voxel grid, which also indicates the maximum number of chunks that can be created for each axis.  
- The maximum number of chunks is determined by `chunk_count.x * chunk_count.y * chunk_count.z`.
- Example: If your object is tall (Y axis) but thin (X, Z), you might increase the count on the Y axis while keeping the other two values low to achieve the desired effect.

### `@export var chunk_vertices_threshold: int = 32`
**Description:**  
Sets the minimum number of vertices required for a chunk to be retained.  
- Choosing this value carefully is important to avoid creating insignificant chunks. 
- Note: Higher values can reduce the number of chunks created.
- **Tip:** Monitor the console when generating chunks to see the vertex count for each chunk, and adjust this value accordingly.

### `@export var chunk_random_sampling: bool = true`
**Description:**  
When set to `false`, chunks are removed from the mesh starting from the minimum position of the bounding box.  
- Disable this flag if you need more regular and predictable chunking results.

### `@export var chunk_noise_factor: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO`
**Description:**  
Specifies the amount of noise applied to the brush geometry before computations.  
- Adding noise can create interesting irregularities but may also cause artifacts.
- This factor is size-dependent. If you notice excessive artifacts, try setting the noise factor to `0`.

### `@export var chunk_opt_preload: bool = true`
**Description:**  
If `true`, chunk computation will occur at loading time.  
- When `false`, chunks will only be calculated when the `smash_the_mesh()` method is called.

### `@export var chunk_opt_already_smashed: bool = false`
**Description:**  
If `true`, the `smash_the_mesh()` method will be automatically called at the start.
